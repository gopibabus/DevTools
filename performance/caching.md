### ✳Caching in our applications

?> **Caching** keeps frequently accessed objects, images and data closer to where you need them, speeding up access to websites you hit often.

> In the above figure we can implement caching in following places:

1. Used **CDNs** to cache static assets like images, html, css and javascript files.
1. Used **Browser Cache Storage** to cache static assets like images, html, css and javascript files.
1. We used **Redis** to cache API requests and database requests.
1. We used database built in caches such as the **InnoDB buffer cache**, to keep blocks of data in memory, reducing slower requests from disk.

> Following figure explains how modern applications are taking advantage of caching.
