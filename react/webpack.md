# 🔥Module Bundling(Webpack)

On a high level, module bundling is simply the process of stitching together(js, css) a group of modules (and their dependencies) into a single file (or group of files) in the correct order.

Main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of **transforming**, **bundling**, or **packaging** just about any resource or asset.
