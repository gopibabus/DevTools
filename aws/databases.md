# ðŸ”¥AWS Databases

!> Some of the the challenges faced by DBAs can be eliminated by using Database as a Service (DBaaS). Most tasks related to sizing, configuration, database software installation, security, monitoring, automation, backup and recovery, and cost are taken care of by the service providers with transparency and cost control for the users.

?> **Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)** makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business. Amazon RDS provides six familiar database engines to choose from, including **Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server**.

### âœ³Amazon Aurora

?>**Amazon Aurora is a relational database engine**. It is designed to deliver the speed and reliability of high-end commercial databases in a simple and cost-effective manner. Aurora is designed to be **compatible with MySQL 5.6** and delivers five times the throughput of standard MySQL running on the same hardware. DBAs are able to save time on planning backup storage disks, as data is **continuously backed up to AWS S3 in real time**, with no performance impact to the end user. This eliminates the need for backup windows and automated backup scripts.
