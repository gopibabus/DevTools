?> **Logs** are the medium through which your app speaks to you. Logging is the foundation for solving your operational problems so not having them is being in a communication void with your application. Logging in any application is very important, you can log a lot of critical things and gain unprecedented insight into how your application is working and performing.

> **As an example**, if you create a user, just log that the user has been created successfully and if the user could not be created because of let's say a database exception it is even more important to log the reason behind the unsuccessful operation.

## âš¡Severity of logs

* **0 Emergency**: the system is unusable
* **1 Alert**: action must be taken immediately
* **2 Critical**: critical conditions
* **3 Error**: error
* **4 Warning**: warning
* **5 Notice**: normal but significant
* **6 Informational**: informational
* **7 Debug**: debug-level messages
