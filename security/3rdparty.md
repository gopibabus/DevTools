# ðŸ”¥Vulnerabilities in 3rd Party Libraries

?> Many applications use third-party software libraries, often without full knowledge of the behavior of the libraries by the application developer. Vulnerabilities in these third-party libraries could potentially be exploited in any application that uses the library, and even if the vulnerabilities are fixed, many applications may still use older, vulnerable versions of the library. So we should identify vulnerabilities in 3rd party packages that we are using as dependencies in our applications.
