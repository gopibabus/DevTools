## âš¡Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

?> **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which theyâ€™re currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.
