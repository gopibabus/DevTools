?> 🌐 **Access control** is a security term used to refer to a set of policies for restricting access to information, tools, and physical locations. Information access control restricts access to data as well as software used to manipulate that data. **Information access control** is very commonly used in computer and network security.

> In information security, computer science, and other fields, the **principle of least privilege (PoLP)**, also known as the principle of minimal privilege or the principle of least authority, requires that in a particular abstraction layer of a computing environment, every module (such as a process, a user, or a program, depending on the subject) must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose.

> **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) from its own.

?> There are so many packages that made easy implementing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) is one of them.
